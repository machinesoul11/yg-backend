# Email Verification System - Implementation Documentation

## Overview

The email verification system for YES GODDESS has been successfully implemented as part of Phase 3 Authentication tasks. This system ensures that users verify their email addresses before accessing protected features of the platform.

---

## âœ… Implemented Features

### 1. Token Generation System
- **Location**: `src/lib/services/auth.service.ts`
- **Method**: `generateToken()`
- Generates cryptographically secure 64-character hex tokens using Node.js crypto module
- Tokens are unique and collision-resistant
- Automatically created during user registration

### 2. Email Verification Template
- **Location**: `emails/templates/EmailVerification.tsx`
- React Email component with YES GODDESS branding
- Includes verification link button with 24-hour expiry notice
- Responsive design for all email clients
- Brand colors (VOID/BONE/ALTAR gold)
- Clear call-to-action and security messaging

### 3. Email Sending Integration
- **Service**: `src/lib/services/email/email.service.ts`
- **Method**: `sendVerificationEmail()`
- Uses Resend email provider via adapter pattern
- Sends automatically on user registration
- Template rendering with React Email
- Full error handling and logging

### 4. Token Validation & Expiration
- **Service**: `src/lib/services/auth.service.ts`
- **Method**: `verifyEmail(token)`
- **Expiration**: 24 hours from token generation
- Validates token exists in database
- Checks token hasn't expired
- Ensures email not already verified
- Atomic update (user + delete token in transaction)
- Sends welcome email upon successful verification
- Full audit logging

### 5. Verification Link Handling
- **Page**: `src/app/auth/verify-email/page.tsx`
- **API Route**: `src/app/api/auth/verify-email/route.ts`
- Handles verification link clicks from emails
- Beautiful branded UI with loading states
- Success/error/expired state handling
- Automatic redirect to sign-in after verification
- 5-second countdown before redirect
- Helpful error messages for all scenarios

### 6. Resend Verification Flow
- **Service**: `src/lib/services/auth.service.ts`
- **Method**: `resendVerificationEmail(email)`
- **API Route**: `src/app/api/auth/resend-verification/route.ts`
- **Component**: `src/components/auth/ResendVerification.tsx`
- Rate limiting: 3 requests per 10 minutes per IP/email
- Invalidates old tokens before creating new ones
- Silent fail for non-existent users (security)
- Success/error feedback to users
- Can be used as button or inline link

### 7. Verified Badge System
- **Component**: `src/components/ui/VerifiedBadge.tsx`
- Two variants: `VerifiedBadge` and `ConditionalVerifiedBadge`
- Three sizes: sm, md, lg
- Optional "Verified" text label
- Customizable tooltip
- Gold checkmark icon matching brand
- Fully accessible (ARIA labels)
- Examples in `src/examples/verified-badge-usage.tsx`

### 8. Access Control & Middleware
- **Middleware**: `src/middleware.ts`
- Checks email verification status for protected routes
- Redirects unverified users to `/auth/verification-required`
- Admin routes don't require email verification
- Creator and Brand routes require verified email
- Role-based access control remains intact

### 9. Verification Required Page
- **Page**: `src/app/auth/verification-required/page.tsx`
- Shows when unverified users try to access protected routes
- Displays user's email address
- Step-by-step instructions
- Integrated resend verification component
- Automatic redirect if already verified
- Session-aware (requires login)

## Database Schema

The existing Prisma schema already includes all necessary tables and fields:

### User Table
```prisma
model User {
  id                  String               @id @default(cuid())
  email               String               @unique
  email_verified      DateTime?            // Timestamp of verification
  // ... other fields
  verificationTokens  VerificationToken[]
}
```

### VerificationToken Table
```prisma
model VerificationToken {
  id        String   @id @default(cuid())
  userId    String
  token     String   @unique
  expires   DateTime
  createdAt DateTime @default(now())
  user      User     @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)

  @@index([token])
  @@index([expires])
}
```

**No migrations needed** - schema was already in place from Phase 2.

## API Endpoints

### 1. Verify Email (REST)
```
POST /api/auth/verify-email
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "token": "64-character-hex-token"
}

Responses:
- 200: Email verified successfully
- 400: Invalid/expired token, already verified
- 500: Server error
```

### 2. Resend Verification (REST)
```
POST /api/auth/resend-verification
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "email": "user@example.com"
}

Responses:
- 200: Verification email sent (or silent success)
- 400: Email already verified
- 429: Rate limit exceeded
```

### 3. Verify Email (tRPC)
```typescript
// Already implemented
trpc.auth.verifyEmail.mutate({ token: string })
```

### 4. Resend Verification (tRPC)
```typescript
// Already implemented
trpc.auth.resendVerification.mutate({ email: string })
```

---

## User Flow

### New User Registration
1. User fills out registration form
2. Account created with `email_verified = null`
3. Verification token generated (expires in 24 hours)
4. Verification email sent to user
5. User sees "Check your email" message
6. User clicks verification link in email
7. Browser opens `/auth/verify-email?token=...`
8. Token validated, email marked as verified
9. Welcome email sent
10. User redirected to sign-in page
11. User can now access protected features

### Expired Token Flow
1. User clicks expired verification link
2. Page shows "Link Expired" message
3. User clicks "Request New Verification Email"
4. Redirected to sign-in or verification page
5. Can request new email via ResendVerification component

### Unverified Access Attempt
1. User logs in with unverified email
2. JWT token includes `emailVerified: false`
3. User tries to access `/creator/*` or `/brand/*`
4. Middleware catches unverified status
5. User redirected to `/auth/verification-required`
6. Page shows verification pending message
7. User can resend verification email
8. After verification, user can access protected routes

---

## Components

### VerifiedBadge
**Purpose**: Display verification status visually

**Usage**:
```tsx
import { VerifiedBadge, ConditionalVerifiedBadge } from '@/components/ui';

// Always show badge
<VerifiedBadge size="md" showLabel={true} />

// Only show if verified
<ConditionalVerifiedBadge 
  isVerified={!!user.emailVerified}
  size="sm"
/>
```

**Props**:
- `size`: 'sm' | 'md' | 'lg'
- `showLabel`: boolean (show "Verified" text)
- `tooltipText`: string (custom tooltip)
- `className`: string

### ResendVerification
**Purpose**: Allow users to request new verification email

**Usage**:
```tsx
import { ResendVerification } from '@/components/auth/ResendVerification';

// With pre-filled email
<ResendVerification email={user.email} />

// User enters email
<ResendVerification />

// Link variant
<ResendVerification variant="link" />
```

**Props**:
- `email`: string (optional, pre-fill email)
- `variant`: 'button' | 'link'
- `className`: string
- `onSuccess`: () => void
- `onError`: (error: string) => void

## Security Features

### Token Security
- **Length**: 64 characters (256 bits of entropy)
- **Format**: Hexadecimal
- **Generation**: `crypto.randomBytes(32)`
- **Uniqueness**: Database unique constraint
- **Single-use**: Deleted after successful verification

### Expiration
- **Duration**: 24 hours from generation
- **Enforcement**: Checked on validation
- **Cleanup**: Expired tokens can be cleaned up via background job (recommended)

### Rate Limiting
- **Window**: 10 minutes
- **Max Requests**: 3 per IP/email
- **Implementation**: In-memory Map (use Redis in production)
- **Response**: 429 Too Many Requests with retry time

### Email Enumeration Protection
- Silent success when email doesn't exist
- Same response time for existing/non-existing users
- No disclosure of user existence

### Audit Logging
All verification events logged:
- Email verification sent
- Email verified successfully
- Verification failed attempts
- IP address and user agent captured

---

## Integration Points

### 1. User Registration
**File**: `src/lib/services/auth.service.ts`

Token generation and email sending happen automatically:
```typescript
async registerUser(input: RegisterInput) {
  // Create user in transaction
  // Generate verification token
  // Send verification email
  // Log audit event
}
```

### 2. Auth.js Session
**File**: `src/lib/auth.ts`

JWT callback includes email verification status:
```typescript
jwt: async ({ token, user }) => {
  if (user) {
    token.emailVerified = !!user.email_verified;
  }
}
```

Session callback:
```typescript
session: async ({ session, token }) => {
  session.user.emailVerified = token.emailVerified;
}
```

### 3. Protected Routes
**File**: `src/middleware.ts`

Middleware checks verification before allowing access:
```typescript
if (requiresVerification && !token.emailVerified) {
  return redirect('/auth/verification-required');
}
```

---

## Where to Display Verified Badge

### Recommended Locations

1. **User Profile Header**
   - Next to user's name
   - Size: md or lg
   - Show label: optional

2. **Creator Profile Cards**
   - In creator directory/search results
   - Size: sm
   - Show label: false

3. **Brand Profile Pages**
   - Company name header
   - Size: md
   - Show label: true

4. **Admin Dashboard**
   - User management tables
   - User detail views
   - Size: sm or md

5. **Search Results**
   - Next to creator/brand names
   - Size: sm
   - Tooltip: "Verified profile"

6. **Account Settings**
   - Email verification section
   - Size: sm
   - Show verification date

See `src/examples/verified-badge-usage.tsx` for complete implementation examples.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Emails Not Being Received

**Symptoms**: User doesn't receive verification email

**Checks**:
1. Verify Resend API key is correct
2. Check sender email is verified in Resend dashboard
3. Check user's spam folder
4. Verify DNS records (SPF, DKIM, DMARC)
5. Check Resend dashboard for delivery errors
6. Review audit logs for email sent events

**Fix**: Check email provider logs, resend verification

#### Verification Link Doesn't Work

**Symptoms**: Link shows invalid or expired

**Checks**:
1. Token exists in database
2. Token hasn't expired (< 24 hours old)
3. Token matches exactly (no truncation)
4. User's email not already verified
5. Check for database connection issues

**Fix**: Generate new token via resend flow

#### Rate Limiting Too Aggressive

**Symptoms**: Users can't resend verification emails

**Checks**:
1. Current rate limit settings
2. User's request history
3. Time until rate limit reset

**Fix**: Adjust RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW or MAX_REQUESTS constants

#### Middleware Redirect Loop

**Symptoms**: Users stuck in redirect loop

**Checks**:
1. Verification-required page is not in middleware matcher
2. Session includes emailVerified field
3. JWT token has correct emailVerified value

**Fix**: Ensure `/auth/*` routes excluded from verification check

### Logs to Watch

Key log events:
- `EMAIL_VERIFICATION_SENT`
- `EMAIL_VERIFIED`
- `EMAIL_VERIFICATION_FAILED`
- Email delivery failures
- Rate limit exceeded events

### Database Maintenance

Recommended queries:

```sql
-- Find users with unverified emails older than 30 days
SELECT id, email, createdAt 
FROM users 
WHERE email_verified IS NULL 
AND createdAt < NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days';

-- Find expired tokens
SELECT id, userId, expires 
FROM verification_tokens 
WHERE expires < NOW();

-- Delete expired tokens
DELETE FROM verification_tokens 
WHERE expires < NOW();
```
