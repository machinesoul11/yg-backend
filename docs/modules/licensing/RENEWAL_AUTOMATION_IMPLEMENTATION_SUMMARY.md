## Integration Points

### Existing Services Integrated
- `EmailService` - Transactional email sending via Resend
- `AuditService` - Event logging for renewal actions
- `licenseConflictDetectionService` - Conflict checking
- `enhancedLicenseRenewalService` - Existing renewal logic enhanced
- `feeCalculationService` - Pricing calculation patterns reused

### Event System
All renewal actions logged to `events` table:
- `license.renewal_offer` - Offer generated
- `license.renewal_reminder_{stage}` - Notifications sent
- `license.renewal_accepted` - Offer accepted
- `license.renewal_complete_brand` - Confirmation sent to brand
- `license.renewal_complete_creator` - Confirmation sent to creator

## Workflow Examples

### Manual Brand-Initiated Renewal
1. Brand views license expiring in 45 days
2. Calls `checkRenewalEligibility` - shows eligible with warnings
3. Calls `generateRenewalOffer` with AUTOMATIC strategy
4. Reviews pricing breakdown showing 5% inflation + 5% loyalty discount
5. Calls `acceptRenewalOffer`
6. New license created with PENDING_APPROVAL status
7. Creators receive approval notification
8. Once approved, confirmation emails sent to all parties

### Automatic Renewal Flow
1. Daily job runs at 02:00 UTC
2. Finds license with autoRenew=true, 60 days until expiration
3. Checks eligibility - passes all checks
4. Generates renewal offer automatically
5. Calculates pricing with automatic strategy
6. Creates new license immediately (no approval needed)
7. Sends confirmation to brand and creators
8. Updates original license metadata with renewal link

### Notification Flow (No Action Taken)
1. **Day 0**: License created, expires in 455 days
2. **Day 365** (90 days out): Initial offer sent with pricing breakdown
3. **Day 395** (60 days out): First reminder sent - medium urgency
4. **Day 425** (30 days out): Second reminder sent - high urgency, elevated design
5. **Day 448** (7 days out): Final notice sent - urgent warning, consequences listed
6. **Day 455**: License expires, status changes to EXPIRED

## Configuration

### Pricing Configuration
Can be customized via `renewalPricingService.updateConfiguration()`:

```typescript
{
  baseInflationRate: 0.05, // 5% default
  loyaltyDiscountThresholds: [
    { renewalCount: 2, discountPercent: 5 },
    { renewalCount: 3, discountPercent: 10 },
    { renewalCount: 5, discountPercent: 15 }
  ],
  earlyRenewalDiscount: {
    daysThreshold: 60,
    discountPercent: 5
  },
  performanceMultipliers: {
    high: 1.15, // 15% increase for high ROI
    medium: 1.0, // No change
    low: 0.95 // 5% decrease for low ROI
  },
  capRules: {
    maxIncreasePercent: 25,
    maxDecreasePercent: 20
  },
  minimumFeeCents: 10000 // $100
}
```

### Notification Stages
Can be customized in `RenewalNotificationService`:

```typescript
[
  { name: 'initial_offer', daysBeforeExpiration: 90, urgencyLevel: 'medium' },
  { name: 'first_reminder', daysBeforeExpiration: 60, urgencyLevel: 'medium' },
  { name: 'second_reminder', daysBeforeExpiration: 30, urgencyLevel: 'high' },
  { name: 'final_notice', daysBeforeExpiration: 7, urgencyLevel: 'final' }
]
```

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests Needed
- Eligibility service validation logic
- Pricing calculator strategies
- Notification stage determination
- Analytics calculations

### Integration Tests Needed
- Complete renewal workflow from offer to acceptance
- Auto-renewal processing
- Notification delivery and idempotency
- Pipeline analytics aggregation

### Test Fixtures
Create representative test data:
- Licenses at various expiration stages (90d, 60d, 30d, 7d)
- Brands with different renewal histories (0, 1, 3, 5 renewals)
- Usage data for performance-based pricing
- Conflict scenarios

## Monitoring Recommendations

### Key Metrics to Track
- **Renewal Rate**: Target >70%, Alert <60%
- **Revenue Retention**: Target >85%, Alert <75%
- **Notification Delivery**: Target >95%, Alert <90%
- **Auto-Renewal Success**: Target >90%, Alert <80%
- **Average Time to Renewal**: Baseline 14 days, Alert >21 days

### Dashboard Views
1. **Pipeline Health**: Licenses by stage, forecasted revenue, at-risk count
2. **Performance Trends**: Renewal rate over time, revenue retention trends
3. **Notification Effectiveness**: Open rates, click rates, conversion by stage
4. **Pricing Analysis**: Strategy distribution, average adjustments, acceptance rates

### Alerts to Configure
- Daily job failures
- Renewal rate drops below threshold
- >10 licenses expiring within 7 days without offers
- Auto-renewal failure spike
- Email delivery failure spike

## Security & Compliance

### Authorization
- Brand can only view/accept renewals for their own licenses
- Creators can view renewals affecting their IP assets
- Admin has full visibility and override capability
- All renewal acceptances require authenticated user

### Audit Trail
- All renewal actions logged to events table
- Email notifications logged with delivery status
- IP address and user agent captured on acceptance
- Pricing calculations stored for review
- Offer expiration enforced (30 days)

### Data Privacy
- Creator email addresses not exposed in brand emails
- Pricing breakdowns only visible to authorized parties
- Historical renewal data aggregated for analytics

## Performance Optimization

### Database Indexes
Existing indexes leveraged:
- `licenses(endDate, status)` - Expiration queries
- `licenses(brandId, status)` - Brand license queries
- `licenses(ipAssetId)` - Asset relationship queries

### Caching Strategy
- Eligibility checks cached for 1 hour
- Pricing configuration cached in memory
- Analytics aggregated once daily

### Batch Processing
- Notifications processed in batches of 100
- Auto-renewals processed sequentially with error isolation
- Analytics calculated in background job

## Known Limitations

1. **Negotiation Workflow**: NEGOTIATED pricing strategy exists but no UI/workflow for back-and-forth negotiation
2. **Multi-Year Renewals**: System supports but not explicitly designed for multi-year renewals
3. **Bulk Management**: No bulk renewal actions (approve/reject multiple at once)
4. **A/B Testing**: No notification timing/content testing framework
5. **ML Pricing**: Performance-based pricing uses simple rules, not ML models

## Future Enhancement Opportunities

1. **Renewal Negotiation Portal**: Brand UI to counter-offer pricing
2. **Renewal Incentive Campaigns**: Targeted discounts for specific cohorts
3. **Predictive Analytics**: ML model to predict renewal likelihood
4. **Multi-Year Discounts**: Automatic discounts for 2-3 year commitments
5. **Renewal Templates**: Pre-configured renewal strategies by asset type
6. **White-Label Notifications**: Brand-customized renewal emails
7. **Renewal Dashboard Widget**: Admin view of real-time pipeline
8. **Automated Escalation**: Notify account managers of at-risk renewals
