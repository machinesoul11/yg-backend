  }
}
```

### 3. Using Storage Provider

```typescript
import { storageProvider } from '@/lib/storage'

// Generate upload URL
const { uploadUrl, key } = await storageProvider.getUploadUrl({
  key: 'assets/cm1abc123xyz/photo.jpg',
  contentType: 'image/jpeg',
  expiresIn: 900 // 15 minutes
})

// Upload file (from frontend)
await fetch(uploadUrl, {
  method: 'PUT',
  body: file,
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'image/jpeg' }
})

// Get download URL
const { url, expiresAt } = await storageProvider.getDownloadUrl({
  key: 'assets/cm1abc123xyz/photo.jpg',
  expiresIn: 3600 // 1 hour
})

// Delete file
await storageProvider.delete('assets/cm1abc123xyz/photo.jpg')
```
