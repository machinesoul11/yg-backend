// In your app initialization (e.g., instrumentation.ts)
import { scheduleUploadCleanup } from '@/jobs/upload-cleanup.job';

export async function register() {
  if (process.env.NEXT_RUNTIME === 'nodejs') {
    await scheduleUploadCleanup();
  }
}
```

### Manual Operations

```bash
# Trigger manual cleanup
npx tsx -e "
import { uploadCleanupQueue } from './src/jobs/upload-cleanup.job';
await uploadCleanupQueue.add('cleanup', {});
"

# Check queue status
npx tsx -e "
import { redis } from './src/lib/redis';
const keys = await redis.keys('bull:asset-virus-scan:*');
console.log(keys);
"
```

## 📝 Notes

### Code Quality

- All TypeScript types are properly defined
- Error handling is comprehensive
- Logging is consistent and helpful
- Code follows project conventions
- Documentation is complete

### Integration Points

- Uses existing Redis connection
- Uses existing storage provider
- Uses existing database (Prisma)
- Uses existing job queue (BullMQ)
- Uses existing analytics infrastructure

### Maintenance

- Jobs are idempotent
