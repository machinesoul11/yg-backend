## 🔒 Security Features Implemented

### Data Isolation
- ✅ Complete tenant separation
- ✅ Role-based access control
- ✅ Ownership verification
- ✅ Financial data protection (creator-only)
- ✅ Admin-only fields protection
- ✅ Cross-tenant access prevention

### Field-Level Protection
- ✅ Email addresses (owner only)
- ✅ Payment information (owner/admin)
- ✅ Internal notes (admin only)
- ✅ Performance metrics (owner/admin)
- ✅ Stripe account IDs (owner/admin)
- ✅ Billing information (owner/admin)

### Aggregation Security
- ✅ Minimum dataset size enforcement (default: 5)
- ✅ Null returns for small datasets
- ✅ Filters applied before aggregation
- ✅ Prevention of row counting attacks
- ✅ Prevention of existence inference
- ✅ Protection of sensitive statistics

## 🎯 Usage Patterns Supported

### 1. Basic List Query
```typescript
const scopedQuery = createTenantScopedQuery(prisma, ctx.securityContext!);
const assets = await scopedQuery.findManyWithScope('ipAsset');
```

### 2. Filtered Query
```typescript
const assets = await scopedQuery.findManyWithScope('ipAsset', {
  where: { status: 'PUBLISHED' },
});
```

### 3. Paginated Query
```typescript
const result = await scopedQuery.findManyPaginated(
  'project',
  { page: 1, pageSize: 20 }
);
```

### 4. Ownership Verification
```typescript
await verifyOwnership(prisma, ctx, assetId);
await prisma.ipAsset.update({ where: { id: assetId }, data });
```

### 5. Field Filtering
```typescript
const allowedFields = getAllowedSelectFields(ctx, 'creator');
const creator = await prisma.creator.findUnique({
  where: { id },
  select: allowedFields,
});
```

### 6. Secure Aggregation
```typescript
const earnings = await calculateCreatorEarnings(prisma, ctx);
const spend = await calculateBrandSpend(prisma, ctx);
```

## 🚀 Ready for Use

The Query Filtering system is **production-ready** and can be used immediately:

1. **Import the utilities**
   ```typescript
   import { createTenantScopedQuery } from '@/lib/query-filters';
   ```

2. **Use in tRPC routers**
   ```typescript
   const scopedQuery = createTenantScopedQuery(prisma, ctx.securityContext!);
   ```

3. **Apply to existing queries**
   ```typescript
   const assets = await scopedQuery.findManyWithScope('ipAsset', {
     where: yourFilters,
   });
   ```
