- `post_workflow_history_*_idx` - Multiple indexes for workflow history

## üîå API Endpoints Added

## üîÑ Integration Points

### Existing Systems Enhanced
- **Blog Service**: Extended with workflow capabilities
- **Scheduled Publishing Job**: Enhanced with new workflow states
- **Notification System**: Integrated for workflow notifications
- **Audit System**: Enhanced with workflow event logging
- **User Management**: Integrated with assignment and permissions

### Backward Compatibility
- ‚úÖ All existing API endpoints remain functional
- ‚úÖ No breaking changes to existing blog functionality
- ‚úÖ Existing posts remain in current states
- ‚úÖ Migration is additive only

## üöÄ Next Steps

### Immediate (Required for Full Functionality)
1. **Run Database Migration**: Apply schema changes to database
2. **Regenerate Prisma Client**: Update client with new schema
3. **Update Main Router**: Add contentWorkflowRouter to main tRPC router
4. **Environment Setup**: Ensure notification service dependencies are configured

### Post-Migration Tasks
1. **Test Workflow Transitions**: Verify all 8 workflow transitions work correctly
2. **Test Bulk Operations**: Validate bulk operation processing and limits
3. **Calendar Integration**: Test scheduling and calendar view functionality
4. **Permission Validation**: Ensure role-based access control works properly

### Optional Enhancements
1. **Frontend Integration**: Build admin UI for editorial workflow features
2. **Advanced Notifications**: Email templates for workflow notifications
3. **Reporting Dashboard**: Analytics for editorial workflow performance
4. **Custom Workflow Rules**: Per-category or per-author workflow configurations

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### Type Issues (Temporary)
- Some TypeScript errors exist due to Prisma client not being regenerated
- All services use `as any` type assertions where needed for new schema fields
- These will resolve automatically after Prisma client regeneration

### Performance Considerations
- Bulk operations limited to 100 posts maximum
- Calendar queries optimized with proper indexing
- Revision comparisons may be CPU intensive for very large content

### Security Implemented
- Role-based access control for all operations
- Permission validation for assignments and transitions  
- Audit logging for all workflow changes
- Input validation and sanitization
