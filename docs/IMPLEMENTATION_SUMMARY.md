2. `docs/infrastructure/storage/FILE_MANAGEMENT_CHECKLIST.md` (Quick reference)
3. This summary document

## üîí Security & Safeguards

### Permission Model
- All API endpoints require ADMIN role
- Per-asset permission validation
- User ownership verification for non-admin operations

### Data Protection
- Soft delete prevents accidental data loss
- Preview mode before destructive operations
- Active license checking
- Relationship impact analysis
- Comprehensive audit logging

### Validation
- Path traversal prevention
- Circular dependency detection
- File size and type validation
- Storage key validation
- Relationship type validation

## üéØ Key Design Decisions

### 1. Existing Schema Utilization
- Used existing `version` and `parent_asset_id` fields from `ip_assets` table
- Used existing `status` enum (added ARCHIVED status usage)
- Minimized schema changes to prevent breaking existing code

### 2. Soft Delete Pattern
- All deletions are soft deletes (set `deleted_at`)
- Allows recovery and audit trail
- Storage cleanup can be scheduled separately

### 3. Batch Processing
- Bulk operations process in batches of 50
- Transaction boundaries ensure consistency
- Prevents timeout and memory issues

### 4. Time-Series Metrics
- Daily snapshot capture at 2 AM
- Efficient querying with proper indexes
- Growth rate calculation in basis points

### 5. Graph-Based Relationships
- Flexible relationship modeling
- Efficient bidirectional queries
- Depth-limited traversal for performance

## üìä Performance Optimizations

### Database Indexes
```sql
-- File Relationships
CREATE INDEX ON file_relationships(source_asset_id);
CREATE INDEX ON file_relationships(target_asset_id);
CREATE INDEX ON file_relationships(relationship_type);

-- Storage Metrics
CREATE INDEX ON storage_metrics(snapshot_date DESC);
CREATE INDEX ON storage_metrics(entity_type, entity_id, snapshot_date DESC);
```

### Query Optimization
- Batch processing to reduce query count
- Proper use of transactions
- Selective field retrieval
- Pagination support

### Caching Strategy
- Storage metrics cache for 1 hour
- Relationship graphs cache for 15 minutes
- Quota checks cache for 5 minutes

## üîÑ Integration Points

### Existing Systems
‚úÖ Integrates with:
- Audit service (all operations logged)
- Storage provider (R2 implementation)
- IP Assets module (versioning, relationships)
- Permission system (role-based access)
- Prisma ORM (type-safe queries)

### No Breaking Changes
- All existing upload flows continue to work
- Existing storage keys remain valid
- Version field is optional (defaults to 1)
- Archive is just a status change

## üöÄ Deployment Steps

### 1. Database Migrations
```bash
# Apply new tables
psql $DATABASE_URL -f prisma/migrations/015_file_relationships_table.sql
psql $DATABASE_URL -f prisma/migrations/016_storage_metrics_table.sql

# Regenerate Prisma client
npx prisma generate
```

### 2. Environment Variables
No new environment variables required. Uses existing:
- `DATABASE_URL` - Database connection
- `STORAGE_PROVIDER` - Storage configuration
- `NODE_ENV` - Environment detection

### 3. Background Job Setup
```typescript
// Add to job scheduler
import { scheduleStorageMetricsJob } from '@/jobs/storage-metrics-calculation.job';

const job = scheduleStorageMetricsJob();
// Register with BullMQ or your job system
```

### 4. Verification
```bash
# Test bulk delete preview
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/admin/storage/bulk-delete/preview \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_TOKEN" \
  -d '{"assetIds": ["test_asset"]}'

# Test storage report
curl http://localhost:3000/api/admin/storage/reports \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_TOKEN"
```

## ‚úÖ Acceptance Criteria Met

All requirements from the instruction set have been successfully implemented:

- ‚úÖ File organization structure with hierarchical paths
- ‚úÖ UUID-based naming conventions with variants
- ‚úÖ File versioning system with complete history
- ‚úÖ File relationship tracking with graph traversal
- ‚úÖ Bulk delete operations with safeguards
- ‚úÖ Archive functionality with reversibility
- ‚úÖ Storage usage reporting with trends and analytics

### Additional Quality Measures
- ‚úÖ No duplicate code or functionality
- ‚úÖ No breaking changes to existing systems
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive error handling
- ‚úÖ Full audit logging
- ‚úÖ Admin-only access controls
- ‚úÖ Complete documentation
- ‚úÖ Database migrations provided
- ‚úÖ Type-safe implementations

## üìù Notes

1. **Prisma Client Regeneration Required**: After applying migrations, run `npx prisma generate` to update the Prisma client with new models.

2. **Background Job Scheduling**: The storage metrics job needs to be registered with your job queue system (BullMQ).

3. **Initial Metrics Capture**: Run `triggerStorageMetricsCalculation()` once manually to populate initial metrics.

4. **Archive Status**: Uses existing ARCHIVED status in AssetStatus enum - no enum changes needed.

5. **Soft Delete Pattern**: All deletes set `deleted_at` timestamp - no hard deletes occur.
