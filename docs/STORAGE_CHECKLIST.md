## 📊 Verification Steps

### Infrastructure Verification
```bash
# Test R2 connectivity
curl -X GET "https://[account-id].r2.cloudflarestorage.com/[bucket-name]" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer [token]"

# Verify CORS
curl -X OPTIONS "https://[bucket-url]" \
  -H "Origin: http://localhost:3000" \
  -H "Access-Control-Request-Method: PUT"

# List buckets
aws s3 ls --endpoint-url https://[account-id].r2.cloudflarestorage.com
```

### Application Verification
```bash
# Check storage configuration
npm run dev
# Navigate to /api/admin/storage/health

# Test upload flow (requires implementation)
# 1. Generate upload URL
# 2. Upload file to R2
# 3. Confirm upload
# 4. Verify in database

# Test monitoring

## 📝 Notes

### Implementation Status
The storage infrastructure layer is **COMPLETE**:
- ✅ Cloudflare R2 provider implementation
- ✅ Configuration and environment setup
- ✅ Monitoring and health checks
- ✅ Admin API endpoints
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation
- ✅ Security model defined
- ✅ Directory structure defined

**Next Phase:** Implement StorageService and tRPC API routes to connect frontend to storage backend.

### Known Issues
- AWS SDK types may require `@types/node` for proper type resolution
- Prisma schema needs IPAsset model before service layer can be implemented
- Background job queue (BullMQ) needs to be set up before jobs can run

### Dependencies Installed
- @aws-sdk/client-s3 (v3.x)
- @aws-sdk/s3-request-presigner (v3.x)
- nanoid (v5.x)
