## Emergency Procedures

### If Migration Fails Mid-Execution

1. **Stay calm** - don't make hasty decisions
2. **Check error message** in workflow logs
3. **Assess severity**:
   - Can it wait for a fix?
   - Does it require immediate rollback?
   - Is data at risk?

4. **Follow appropriate path**:
   - **Minor issue**: Fix and re-run
   - **Major issue**: Execute rollback
   - **Data corruption**: Restore from backup

5. **Communicate constantly** with team

### If Application Breaks After Migration

1. **Identify if it's migration-related**:
   - Check error logs for database errors
   - Verify schema changes are the cause
   - Rule out unrelated issues

2. **Quick fix options**:
   - Deploy application hotfix
   - Adjust application code
   - Add missing indexes

3. **If quick fix not possible**:
   - Execute database rollback
   - Redeploy previous application version
   - Investigate issue in non-prod environment

### If Backup Fails

1. **Do NOT proceed** with migration
2. **Investigate backup failure**:
   - Check Supabase dashboard
   - Verify API credentials
   - Check project tier/limits

3. **Create manual backup**:
   ```bash
   pg_dump $DATABASE_URL > manual_backup_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).sql
   ```

4. **Verify backup**:
   ```bash
   pg_restore -l manual_backup_*.sql
   ```

5. **Only proceed** once backup is confirmed

## Tips for Success

### Before Migration
✅ Test extensively in staging  
✅ Review SQL carefully  
✅ Have rollback plan ready  
✅ Schedule during low-traffic periods  
✅ Communicate with team  

### During Migration
✅ Monitor actively  
✅ Don't multitask  
✅ Keep team informed  
✅ Document any issues  
✅ Take screenshots of key steps  

### After Migration
✅ Verify thoroughly  
✅ Monitor metrics  
✅ Stay alert for issues  
✅ Document lessons learned  
✅ Update procedures if needed  

---

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

❌ **Skipping staging** - Always test in staging first  
❌ **Rushing production** - Take time to verify  
❌ **Ignoring warnings** - Investigate all warnings  
❌ **Poor communication** - Keep team informed  
❌ **No rollback plan** - Always have an escape route  
❌ **Deploying during peak** - Choose low-traffic times  
❌ **Untested rollbacks** - Test rollback procedures  
❌ **Missing backups** - Verify backup exists

# One migration needs to be applied
20251010000000_add_audit_entity_fields
```

**To Apply:**
```bash
npm run db:migrate:deploy
```

---

## 2. Prisma Client Generation - COMPLETE ✅

### Configuration

The Prisma Client is properly configured with:

```prisma
generator client {
  provider        = "prisma-client-js"
  previewFeatures = ["fullTextSearchPostgres", "metrics"]
}

datasource db {
  provider  = "postgresql"
  url       = env("DATABASE_URL_POOLED")
  directUrl = env("DATABASE_URL")
}
```

### Client Features

- ✅ **Singleton Pattern**: Prevents connection exhaustion in Next.js
- ✅ **Read/Write Routing**: Separate clients for primary and replica
- ✅ **Connection Pooling**: PgBouncer-compatible configuration
- ✅ **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support for all models
- ✅ **Query Monitoring**: Performance tracking and slow query detection

### Client Location

**Primary Client:**
```typescript
// src/lib/db/index.ts
export const prisma = globalForPrisma.prisma ?? new PrismaClient(DATABASE_CONFIG);
export const prismaRead = REPLICA_CONFIG ? new PrismaClient(REPLICA_CONFIG) : prisma;
```

### NPM Scripts

```json
{
  "db:generate": "prisma generate",
  "db:push": "prisma db push",
  "db:migrate": "prisma migrate dev",
  "db:migrate:deploy": "prisma migrate deploy",
  "db:migrate:status": "prisma migrate status",
  "db:migrate:resolve": "prisma migrate resolve"
}
```

## 3. Migration Rollback Procedures - ENHANCED ⚠️

### Current State

Prisma creates forward-only migrations. The project previously lacked formal rollback scripts.

### Enhancement: Rollback Templates Created

Created rollback procedure templates for all major migrations:

#### Rollback Strategy

**Location:** `prisma/migrations/rollbacks/`

**Template Structure:**
```
rollbacks/
├── ROLLBACK_TEMPLATE.md                 # Standard rollback procedure
├── 001_users_authentication_rollback.sql
├── 002_creators_rollback.sql
├── 003_brands_rollback.sql
├── 004_projects_rollback.sql
├── 005_payouts_rollback.sql
└── system_tables_rollback.sql
```

#### Rollback Execution Process

**Step 1: Backup Current State**
```bash
# Create backup before rollback
pg_dump $DATABASE_URL > backup_before_rollback_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).sql
```

**Step 2: Execute Rollback**
```bash
# Review the rollback script first
cat prisma/migrations/rollbacks/[migration]_rollback.sql

# Execute rollback
psql $DATABASE_URL < prisma/migrations/rollbacks/[migration]_rollback.sql
```

**Step 3: Mark Migration as Rolled Back**
```bash
npm run db:migrate:resolve -- --rolled-back [migration_name]
```

**Step 4: Verify Database State**
```bash
npm run db:health
npm run db:migrate:status
```

### Rollback Testing

**Test Environment Procedure:**
1. Create test database snapshot
2. Apply migration
3. Verify migration success
4. Execute rollback script
5. Verify database returns to pre-migration state
6. Document any issues

**Testing Checklist:**
- [ ] Rollback script syntax is valid
- [ ] Foreign key constraints are handled correctly
- [ ] Data loss is acceptable/documented
- [ ] Application code still functions
- [ ] No orphaned data remains

---

npm run db:seed

# Expected output shows counts of created records
```

### Seed Data Credentials

```

### Enhancement: CI/CD Templates & Strategy

Created comprehensive CI/CD integration templates and documentation.

#### Recommended CI/CD Structure

```
.github/
└── workflows/
    ├── database-migration.yml        # Migration workflow
    ├── database-test.yml              # Migration testing
    ├── database-backup.yml            # Pre-deployment backup
    └── deploy-production.yml          # Full deployment pipeline
```

#### Migration Workflow Strategy

**Development/Staging:**
```yaml
# Trigger: Push to develop branch
1. Run tests
2. Generate Prisma Client
3. Apply migrations to staging database
4. Run seed scripts
5. Verify migration success
6. Deploy application to staging
```

**Production:**
```yaml
# Trigger: Release tag or manual approval
1. Create database backup
2. Run migration dry-run
3. Require manual approval
4. Apply migrations to production
5. Verify migration success
6. Deploy application to production
7. Monitor for errors
8. Send deployment notification
```

#### Environment Variables for CI/CD

**Required Secrets:**
- `DATABASE_URL` - Direct connection for migrations
- `DATABASE_URL_POOLED` - Pooled connection for app
- `DATABASE_REPLICA_URL` - Read replica connection (optional)
- `SUPABASE_PROJECT_ID` - For backup API calls
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY` - For admin operations
- `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL` - For deployment notifications (optional)

#### Deployment Safety Features

1. **Pre-Deployment Checks**
   - Verify backup exists
   - Check migration status
   - Validate schema changes
   - Run migration tests

2. **Migration Execution**
   - Use transactions where possible
   - Monitor execution time
   - Log all operations
   - Capture error details

3. **Post-Deployment Verification**
   - Health check endpoints
   - Schema validation
   - Replication lag check
   - Application smoke tests

4. **Rollback Triggers**
   - Migration failure
   - Health check failure
   - Error rate spike
   - Manual intervention

#### Monitoring & Alerts

**Slack/Discord Notifications:**
- Migration started
- Migration completed
- Migration failed
- Rollback initiated
- Health check status

**Metrics to Track:**
- Migration execution time
- Database connection health
- Query performance degradation
- Error rates post-deployment
