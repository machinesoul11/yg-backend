### Integration Points
- **PrismaClient**: Database operations using existing schema
- **AuditService**: Leverages existing audit infrastructure
- **Stripe SDK**: Direct integration for reconciliation
- **File System**: Bank statement processing
- **TypeScript**: Full type safety with 40+ interfaces

## Usage

### Service Factory
```typescript
import { createAuditReconciliationServices } from '@/modules/audit-reconciliation';

const services = createAuditReconciliationServices(
  prismaClient,
  auditService,
  stripeSecretKey
);
```

### Generate Reports
```typescript
// Transaction audit trail
const auditReport = await services.transactionAuditTrail.generateAuditTrailReport({
  startDate: new Date('2024-01-01'),
  endDate: new Date('2024-01-31'),
  requestedBy: 'admin@yesgoddess.com'
});

// Stripe reconciliation
const stripeReport = await services.stripeReconciliation.generateReconciliationReport({
  startDate: new Date('2024-01-01'),
  endDate: new Date('2024-01-31'),
  includeDiscrepanciesOnly: false
});

// Discrepancy detection
const discrepancyReport = await services.discrepancyDetection.generateDiscrepancyReport();
```

### Bank Statement Processing
```typescript
const bankStatement = fs.readFileSync('./bank-statement.csv', 'utf8');
const reconciliationReport = await services.bankReconciliation.processStatementData(
  bankStatement,
  'csv',
  {
    startDate: new Date('2024-01-01'),
    endDate: new Date('2024-01-31')
  }
);
```

## Report Types

All reports implement the `BaseReport` interface and include:
- Unique report ID and generation metadata
- Period-based filtering
- Comprehensive analytics and breakdowns
- Export capabilities (JSON format)
- Audit logging of report generation

## Data Sources

### Internal Data
- Payment transactions (Prisma schema)
- Payout records
- License agreements
- Audit events
- User actions

### External Data
- Stripe charges, transfers, disputes
- Bank statement files
- Payment processor webhooks

## Compliance Features

### Regulatory Support
- Large transaction flagging (>$10,000)
- International transaction monitoring
- Suspicious activity detection
- Manual intervention tracking
- Fraud indicator identification

### Audit Trail
- Every report generation logged
- User attribution for all actions
- System state preservation
- Error tracking and recovery
- Compliance-level categorization

## Performance Considerations

- Pagination for large datasets
- Configurable result limits
- Background processing support
- Efficient database queries
- Memory-conscious file processing

## Security Features

- User-based access control
- Audit logging of all operations
- Sensitive data sanitization
- Error message scrubbing
- Secure file handling

## Error Handling
